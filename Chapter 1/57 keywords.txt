                                THE 57 KEY WORDS OF JAVA
Abstract – an abstract class cannot be instantiated
Assert    - assert checks if a condition is true during debugging
Boolean – Boolean stores true or false values 
Break – break stops a loop immediately
Byte – byte stores a small integer values 
Case – case defines an option inside a switch statement
Catch – catch handles an exception
Char -char stores a single character
Class - class defines a blueprint for objects
Const – const is reserved but not used in java.
Continue -skips to the next loop iteration
Default – runs when no switch case matches
Do – starts a do-while loop
Double – double stores decimal numbers with high precision
Else – else runs when an if condition is false
Enum – defines a fixed set of constants
Extends – allows a class to inherit another class 
Final – final prevents modification or inheritance
Finally – always executes after try-catch
Float – stores decimal numbers
For – creates a loop with initialization and update
Goto – reserved but not used
If – checks a condition
Implements – allows a class to use an interface
Import – includes another package
Instanceof – check an object’s type
Int – stores integers
Interface – defines method rules without bodies
Long – stores large integers
Native – links java with other languages like c
New – creates an object 
Package – groups related classes 	
Private – restricts access within a class 
Protected – allows access within package and subclasses
Public – allows access everywhere
Return – sends a value back from a method 
Short – stores small integers 
Static – belongs to the class, not objects
Strictfp – ensures consistent floating-point calculations
Super – refers to the parent class
Switch – switch selects one block among many
Synchronized – controls thread access
 This – refers to the current object
Throw – declares possible exceptions 
Void – means no return value
Transient – prevents serialization of a variable
Try – tests code that may cause exceptions
Volatile – ensures variable updates across threads
While – repeats code while a condition is true
True – represents a Boolean true value
False – represents a Boolean false value
Null – means no objects reference 
Var – lets java infer variable type (java 10+)
Yield – returns a value in a switch expression 
Record – creates a compact data class 
Sealed – restricts which classes can extend a class
